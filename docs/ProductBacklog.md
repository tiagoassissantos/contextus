- **Best Ideas**: Enhanced descriptions and additional fields (Priority, Notes) were inspired by `ProductBacklog-3.md`’s detailed approach, while broad language support and advanced features were drawn from all backlogs.
- **Structure**: Epics are organized to align with the system’s lifecycle (setup → analysis → storage → interaction → extensibility), with `Querying & Searching` and `Advanced Features & Extensibility` as distinct enhancements.
- **Prioritization**: High-priority stories reflect foundational needs (e.g., analysis, storage), while lower priorities denote future or advanced capabilities (e.g., 3D visualization).

This backlog serves as a comprehensive starting point, ready for refinement, prioritization, and detailed acceptance criteria in a real-world development context.
