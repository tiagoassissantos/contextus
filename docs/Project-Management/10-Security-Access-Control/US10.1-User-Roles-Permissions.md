# User Story 10.1: User Roles and Permissions

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System Administrator, I want to implement user roles and permissions to control access to project data and system features so that usage is secure.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define a role-based access control (RBAC) model
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement user authentication and authorization
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create an interface for managing user roles and permissions
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Consider integration with existing authentication systems (e.g., OAuth, LDAP) for enterprise environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Different user roles have appropriate access levels
- Unauthorized access attempts are blocked and logged
- Administrators can manage user roles and permissions
- System enforces permissions consistently across all interfaces
