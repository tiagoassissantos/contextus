# User Story 7.1: Editor Integration

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want to integrate the RAG system with my code editor (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ) via a plugin so that I can use it within my existing tools.

## Tasks
- [ ] Research extension/plugin APIs for target editors (VS Code, IntelliJ)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Design plugin architecture that communicates with the RAG system
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement basic plugin functionality for at least one editor
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Focus on VS Code first as it has a well-documented extension API and is widely used across multiple languages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Plugin successfully installs in the target editor
- Plugin establishes connection with the RAG system
- Basic functionality (e.g., sending queries, receiving responses) works within the editor
- Plugin respects editor's UI guidelines and conventions
