# User Story 7.9: Code Structure Exploration

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer (via agent), I want basic code structure exploration commands (e.g., list functions in file X) enabled via MCP so that I can explore my code easily.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define a set of code structure exploration commands
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement command handlers in the MCP protocol
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create response formatters for different command types
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Commands should include listing functions/methods, classes/modules, finding definitions, and showing call hierarchies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- MCP protocol supports a defined set of code structure exploration commands
- Commands work across all supported languages
- Responses are formatted appropriately for each command type
- Commands can be invoked via editor agents or directly through the plugin
- Performance is acceptable even for large files
