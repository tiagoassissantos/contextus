# User Story 7.3: Code Selection Questions

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want to select code in my editor and ask questions about it, receiving responses enhanced by the system's analysis, so that I can troubleshoot quickly.

## Tasks

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can select any code snippet and trigger a question interface
- Questions and selected code are properly sent to the RAG system
- Responses are displayed in a readable format with proper code formatting
- System provides more insightful answers than generic LLM responses due to codebase context
