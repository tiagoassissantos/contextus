# Spike 7.11: Editor Agent Integration

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
Investigate APIs and integration points for target editor agents (e.g., Continue.dev, CodeLLM) to optimize integration.

## Tasks
- [ ] Research and document APIs for target editor agents
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create proof-of-concept integrations with at least two editor agents
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Focus on understanding how these agents handle context, what protocols they use for communication, and how they present information to users.

## Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive documentation of APIs and integration points for target editor agents
- Recommendations for optimal integration approaches
- Identification of potential limitations or challenges
- Proof-of-concept code demonstrating basic integration
- Timeline estimate for full integration implementation
