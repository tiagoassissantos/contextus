**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to understand domain-specific aspects of my project (e.g., business logic, industry standards) for more tailored assistance.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement mechanism for users to define domain-specific terminology and concepts
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create storage for domain knowledge that can be included in context
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Develop logic to incorporate domain knowledge into RAG retrieval
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Domain understanding can come from explicit user input, documentation files, or inferred from code comments and naming patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can define domain-specific terminology and concepts
- System stores and retrieves domain knowledge appropriately
- Domain knowledge is incorporated into RAG context when relevant
- Responses demonstrate understanding of project-specific terminology
- Domain knowledge can be updated and refined over time
