# User Story 7.8: Editor Agent Connection

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer using an Editor Agent (e.g., Continue.dev), I want the agent to connect to the RAG system's MCP endpoint so that integration is possible.

## Tasks
- [ ] Research integration points for popular editor agents (Continue.dev, etc.)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement MCP client adapter for editor agents
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create documentation for connecting third-party agents
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Focus on Continue.dev first as it has an open architecture and growing adoption. Ensure the MCP protocol is well-documented for third-party integrations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Editor agents can connect to the RAG system's MCP endpoint
- Connection is secure and authenticated
- Agents can send queries and receive enhanced responses
- Integration doesn't require extensive configuration
- Documentation clearly explains how to connect third-party agents
