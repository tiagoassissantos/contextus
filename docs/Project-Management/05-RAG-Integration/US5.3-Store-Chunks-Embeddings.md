# User Story 5.3: Store Chunks and Embeddings

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to store the code chunks and their embeddings in a vector store so that they can be retrieved quickly.

## Tasks
- [ ] Select and set up a vector store (e.g., ChromaDB, FAISS, Pinecone, local file-based).
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement logic to index code chunks, their embeddings (US 5.2), and associated metadata (US 5.1) into the vector store.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Ensure the vector store can be updated incrementally as code changes (linking to Epic 3).
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Consider scalability, query speed, and ease of integration of the vector store.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Code chunks, embeddings, and metadata are successfully indexed in the chosen vector store.
- The vector store allows for efficient similarity searches.
- Indexing process can handle updates (add, modify, delete chunks) based on code changes.
