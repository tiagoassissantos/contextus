# Spike 5.8: Evaluate Embeddings and Vector Stores

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
Evaluate different embedding models and vector stores for code-specific tasks to optimize performance and suitability.

## Tasks
- [ ] Identify candidate embedding models (code-specific vs general purpose).
  - Assigned to: [Researcher Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Identify candidate vector stores (local vs cloud, performance characteristics).
  - Assigned to: [Researcher Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Define evaluation criteria (e.g., retrieval accuracy for code tasks, indexing speed, query latency, resource usage).
  - Assigned to: [Researcher Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Conduct benchmark tests using a representative code dataset.
  - Assigned to: [Researcher Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Document findings and recommendations for the optimal combination.
  - Assigned to: [Researcher Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Research task to inform choices made in US 5.2 and US 5.3.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A report comparing different embedding models based on evaluation criteria.
- A report comparing different vector stores based on evaluation criteria.
- Recommendations for the most suitable embedding model and vector store for the project's needs.
- Benchmark results supporting the recommendations.
