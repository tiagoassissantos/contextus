# User Story 5.1: Chunk Code and Metadata

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to chunk the analyzed code and metadata into suitable units for indexing so that retrieval is efficient.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define chunking strategy (e.g., per function, per class, semantic chunking).
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement logic to segment code based on the chosen strategy.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Associate relevant metadata (file path, element type, etc.) with each chunk.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Chunk size and strategy impact retrieval quality and performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Codebase is divided into logical chunks according to the defined strategy.
- Each chunk includes associated metadata (e.g., source file, line numbers, element type).
- Chunking process is repeatable and consistent.
