# User Story 5.4: Vector Similarity Search

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to perform vector similarity searches on the vector store based on input queries so that relevant code is retrieved.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement logic to convert an input query (e.g., natural language question) into an embedding using the same model as US 5.2.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement logic to query the vector store (US 5.3) using the query embedding to find the top-k most similar code chunks.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Retrieve the code content and metadata associated with the top-k results.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Tune the number of results (k) based on performance and context window limitations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System can take an input query string.
- System generates an embedding for the query.
- System performs a similarity search against the vector store using the query embedding.
- System retrieves the content and metadata of the most relevant code chunks based on vector similarity.
