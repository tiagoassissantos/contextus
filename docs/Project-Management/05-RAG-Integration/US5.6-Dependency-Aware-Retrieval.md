# User Story 5.6: Dependency-Aware Retrieval

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want the RAG retrieval to consider dependency information to fetch related code context so that responses are more comprehensive.

## Tasks
- [ ] Enhance the retrieval process (US 5.4) to optionally use dependency information (Epic 4).
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement logic to identify dependencies/dependents of the initially retrieved code chunks.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Retrieve and include relevant code chunks from dependent/dependency files in the context (US 5.5).
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Could involve retrieving chunks from files directly imported/required by the primary results, or files that import/require the primary results.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Retrieval process can optionally fetch additional context based on code dependencies.
- The formatted context (US 5.5) can include code snippets from related files identified via dependency analysis.
- This leads to potentially more comprehensive context for the LLM.
