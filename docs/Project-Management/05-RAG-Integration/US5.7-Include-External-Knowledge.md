# User Story 5.7: Include External Knowledge

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want the option to include external knowledge bases (e.g., API docs, open-source code) in the indexed data so that I can leverage broader insights.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define a process for ingesting and chunking external documentation or code.
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement ingestion mechanism for specified external sources.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Generate embeddings (US 5.2) and index (US 5.3) the external content alongside project code.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Ensure retrieval (US 5.4) can search across both project code and external knowledge.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Requires careful consideration of source formats and relevance filtering.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System provides a mechanism to index specified external knowledge sources (docs, code).
- External content is chunked, embedded, and stored in the vector store.
- Similarity searches (US 5.4) can retrieve relevant information from both the project codebase and indexed external sources.
