# User Story 5.2: Generate Embeddings

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to generate embeddings for the code chunks using a chosen embedding model so that semantic searches are possible.

## Tasks
- [ ] Select and integrate an embedding model suitable for code (e.g., SentenceTransformers, OpenAI Embeddings API, code-specific models).
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement logic to pass code chunks (from US 5.1) to the embedding model.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Store the generated embedding vector alongside its corresponding code chunk data.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Consider model performance, cost, and suitability for different programming languages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Embedding vectors are generated for each code chunk.
- The chosen embedding model is integrated into the system.
- Embeddings are stored and associated with their respective code chunks.
