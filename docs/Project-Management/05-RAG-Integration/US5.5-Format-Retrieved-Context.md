# User Story 5.5: Format Retrieved Context

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to format the retrieved code snippets and metadata into a structured context for the LLM so that it can process it effectively.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define a structured format (e.g., JSON, specific text format) for presenting the retrieved context (code snippets + metadata from US 5.4) to the LLM.
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement logic to assemble the retrieved information into the defined format.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Ensure the format includes necessary metadata (like file paths) for the LLM to understand the context source.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
This formatted context will be sent via the MCP (Epic 6).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Retrieved code chunks and their metadata are formatted into a predefined, structured format.
- The format is suitable for consumption by an LLM.
- Key metadata (e.g., file path, element name) is included in the formatted output.
