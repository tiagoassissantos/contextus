# User Story 1.1: System Initialization

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System Operator, I want a defined process to initialize the system for a new project directory so that I can set up the system easily for new projects.

## Tasks
- [X] Design CLI interface for system initialization (`contextus init <directory>`)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [X] Implement configuration file generation with default settings
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [X] Add validation for project directory structure
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Implement a basic CLI command or setup procedure (e.g., `contextus init <directory>`).

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system can be initialized with a single command
- Configuration file is generated with sensible defaults
- Error handling for invalid directories is implemented
