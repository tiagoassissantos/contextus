# User Story 3.8: Detect Added/Deleted Files

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a System, I want to detect newly added or deleted files and update the stored analysis accordingly so that the data reflects the current project state.

## Tasks
- [ ] Enhance change detection (US 3.4) to explicitly identify added files
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Enhance change detection (US 3.4) to explicitly identify deleted files
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Ensure incremental analysis (US 3.5) correctly processes added and deleted file lists
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
This might be partially covered by US 3.4 and US 3.5 but emphasizes the explicit handling of additions and deletions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Newly added files in the project directory are detected and analyzed during the next incremental update.
- Files deleted from the project directory are detected, and their corresponding data is removed from the analysis results and storage during the next incremental update.
- The stored analysis accurately reflects the current set of files in the project.
