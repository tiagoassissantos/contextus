# User Story 3.2: Automatic Data Saving

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to automatically save the analysis data to disk regularly or upon specific triggers (e.g., after scanning) so that data remains available across sessions.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement logic to serialize analysis data according to the defined schema (US 3.1)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement trigger mechanism for saving (e.g., post-analysis, periodic timer)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Ensure data is written to the designated persistent storage
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Consider performance implications of frequent saving.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Analysis data is automatically saved to persistent storage after analysis runs or at defined intervals.
- Saved data conforms to the defined schema.
- System remains functional across restarts with saved data.
