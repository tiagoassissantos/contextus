# User Story 3.1: Design Storage Schema

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to design a database schema or storage format to persist the analyzed file structure, code elements (classes, methods, etc.), dependencies, and other metadata so that data is preserved.

## Tasks
- [ ] Evaluate storage options (JSON, SQLite, embedded DB)
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Define the schema/format for storing file structure, code elements, and dependencies
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Document the chosen schema/format
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Options include JSON files, SQLite, or an embedded DB.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A clear schema or data format definition exists.
- The schema supports storing file structure, code elements (classes, methods, etc.), dependencies, and relevant metadata.
- The design considers efficiency for storage and retrieval.
