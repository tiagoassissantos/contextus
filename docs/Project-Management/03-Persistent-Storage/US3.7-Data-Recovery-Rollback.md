# User Story 3.7: Data Recovery/Rollback

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a System, I want to provide recovery and rollback capabilities in case of data corruption or errors so that data integrity is maintained.

## Tasks
- [ ] Investigate strategies for data backup (e.g., keeping previous version of data file)
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement basic data validation checks during loading (US 3.3)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement mechanism to revert to a previous valid data state if corruption is detected
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Consider the trade-offs between robustness and storage space/complexity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System can detect potential data corruption during loading.
- A mechanism exists to attempt recovery or rollback to a previous known-good state (e.g., using a backup file).
- Errors during saving/loading are handled gracefully, potentially triggering a full rescan if recovery fails.
