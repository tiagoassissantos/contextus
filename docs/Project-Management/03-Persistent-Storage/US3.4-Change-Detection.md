# User Story 3.4: Change Detection

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to check file timestamps or use other change detection mechanisms to identify modified, added, or deleted files so that updates are efficient.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement mechanism to track last-analyzed timestamps for files
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement logic to compare current file timestamps/state with stored state
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Identify lists of added, modified, and deleted files since the last analysis
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Consider using file system events for more real-time detection if feasible.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System can accurately identify files that have been modified since the last analysis.
- System can accurately identify files that have been added since the last analysis.
- System can accurately identify files that have been deleted since the last analysis.
