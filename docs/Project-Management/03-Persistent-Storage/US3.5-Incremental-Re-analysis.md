# User Story 3.5: Incremental Re-analysis

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to trigger re-analysis only for files that have changed since the last scan and update the stored data accordingly so that resources are conserved.

## Tasks
- [ ] Integrate change detection (US 3.4) output with the analysis module
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement logic to re-analyze only modified files
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement logic to handle added files (perform initial analysis)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement logic to handle deleted files (remove from analysis data)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Update the persistent storage incrementally
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Ensure dependency information is updated correctly when related files change.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Only files identified as changed (added/modified) are re-analyzed.
- Data for deleted files is removed from the analysis results and storage.
- Persistent storage accurately reflects the updated state after incremental analysis.
- Overall analysis time is reduced compared to a full rescan when only a few files change.
