# User Story 3.3: Load Persisted Data

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to load the persisted data when initializing for an existing project to avoid full rescans so that startup is quick.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement logic to detect existing persisted data on startup
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement logic to deserialize and load data from storage into memory
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Integrate loading mechanism into the system initialization process
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Ensure compatibility with the defined storage schema (US 3.1).

## Acceptance Criteria
- System loads previously saved analysis data when starting in a project directory with existing data.
- Startup time is significantly reduced for projects with persisted data compared to a full rescan.
- Loaded data accurately reflects the state at the time of the last save.
