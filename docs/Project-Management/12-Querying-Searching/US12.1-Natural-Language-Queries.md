# User Story 12.1: Natural Language Queries

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want to use natural language queries to find relevant files and functions so that I can quickly locate code without knowing exact names or paths.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design a natural language query parser
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement intent recognition for common code search patterns
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create a ranking system for query results
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Focus on developer-centric queries like "find all functions that handle user authentication" or "show me where API requests are processed".

## Acceptance Criteria
- System correctly interprets natural language queries
- Results are relevant to the query intent
- Query processing is reasonably fast (< 1 second)
- System handles ambiguous queries gracefully with clarification options
