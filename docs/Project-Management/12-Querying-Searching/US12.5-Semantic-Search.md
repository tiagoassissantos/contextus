# User Story 12.5: Semantic Search

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want to perform semantic searches that understand code concepts and functionality so that I can find relevant code even without exact keyword matches.

## Tasks
- [ ] Integrate with the RAG system's vector embeddings
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement semantic similarity search
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create a hybrid search combining keyword and semantic approaches
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Leverage the existing embedding model from the RAG system. Consider techniques to balance precision and recall in semantic searches.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Semantic searches find conceptually related code
- Results include relevant matches even without exact keywords
- Search performance remains acceptable
- Hybrid search effectively combines keyword and semantic approaches
