# User Story 12.3: Code Snippet Highlighting

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want search results to highlight relevant code snippets and related documentation so that I can quickly assess their relevance.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement syntax highlighting for code snippets
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create a system to extract relevant context around matched code
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Associate documentation with code snippets in results
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Ensure that enough context is shown to understand the snippet, but not so much that it becomes overwhelming.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Code snippets are properly syntax highlighted
- Relevant context is shown around matched code
- Associated documentation is displayed when available
- Search terms are visually highlighted in results
