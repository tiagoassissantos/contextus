# User Story 2.1: Project Scanning

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to scan my project's directory and build a file tree structure for all supported languages (Ruby, Elixir, Go, Kotlin, Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust) so that it can navigate and understand the codebase.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define file/folder inclusion and exclusion rules (ignore configured paths like `.git`, `tmp`)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement directory scanning logic
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Output a summary of discovered files/folders
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Ignore configured paths (e.g., `.git`, `tmp`); respect language-specific conventions (e.g., Elixirâ€™s `lib` directory).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Scans and lists all relevant files/folders
- Exclusion rules are respected
- Summary output is accurate
