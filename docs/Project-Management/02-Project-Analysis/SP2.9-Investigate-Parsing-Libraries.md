# Spike 2.9: Investigate Parsing Libraries

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
Investigate robust parsing libraries and tools (e.g., Rubyâ€™s parser gem, Elixir Sense, Credo internals) for each supported language to extract deeper semantics (e.g., method calls, variable assignments).

## Tasks
- [ ] Research and evaluate parsing libraries/tools for Ruby
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Research and evaluate parsing libraries/tools for Elixir
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Research and evaluate parsing libraries/tools for Go
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Research and evaluate parsing libraries/tools for Kotlin
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Research and evaluate parsing libraries/tools for Java
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Research and evaluate parsing libraries/tools for Python
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Research and evaluate parsing libraries/tools for JavaScript/TypeScript
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Research and evaluate parsing libraries/tools for Rust
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Document findings and recommendations
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Research task to enhance future analysis capabilities. Focus on extracting semantic information beyond basic structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Comprehensive list of potential parsing libraries/tools for each supported language.
- Evaluation of their capabilities for extracting deeper semantics (method calls, variable assignments, etc.).
- Recommendations for tools to consider for future implementation.
