# User Story 2.3: Dependency Listing

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to identify and list all third-party libraries and frameworks used in my project, including language-specific package managers (e.g., Gemfile for Ruby, mix.exs for Elixir), so that I can manage external dependencies effectively.

## Tasks
- [ ] Parse lockfiles (e.g., `Gemfile.lock`, `mix.lock`) for version details
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] List all third-party libraries and frameworks
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Parse lockfiles (e.g., `Gemfile.lock`, `mix.lock`) for version details.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All third-party libraries and frameworks are listed
- Version details are included
