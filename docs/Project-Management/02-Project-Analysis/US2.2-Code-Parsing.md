# User Story 2.2: Code Parsing

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to parse source code files and extract structural elements such as classes, methods, functions, modules, and variables for all supported languages so that I can access detailed insights.

## Tasks
- [ ] Identify supported programming languages
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement code parsing for each language (use language-specific parsers: Ripper for Ruby, Elixir’s built-in tools, etc.)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Store parsed data in a structured format
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Use language-specific parsers (e.g., Ripper for Ruby, Elixir’s built-in tools).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Code is parsed for all supported languages
- Extracted data is structured and accessible
- Handles syntax errors gracefully
