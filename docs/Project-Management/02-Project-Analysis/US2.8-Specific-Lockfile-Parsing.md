# User Story 2.8: Specific Lockfile Parsing

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to parse Gemfile.lock and mix.lock to list specific package dependencies and their versions so that I have precise dependency information.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement parser for `Gemfile.lock`
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement parser for `mix.lock`
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Integrate parsed data into the dependency listing
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
This is a more specific version of US2.3, focusing on lockfiles.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System accurately parses `Gemfile.lock` and extracts dependency names and versions.
- System accurately parses `mix.lock` and extracts dependency names and versions.
- Parsed information is available alongside other dependency data.
