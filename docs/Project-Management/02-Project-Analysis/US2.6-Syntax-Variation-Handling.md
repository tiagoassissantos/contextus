# User Story 2.6: Syntax Variation Handling

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to handle common syntax variations and patterns for each supported language gracefully so that analysis is robust.

## Tasks
- [ ] Identify common syntax variations and edge cases for each language
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Enhance parsers to handle identified variations
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Account for Ruby metaprogramming, Elixir macros, etc.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System correctly parses code despite common syntax variations.
- Analysis remains robust across different coding styles within supported languages.
