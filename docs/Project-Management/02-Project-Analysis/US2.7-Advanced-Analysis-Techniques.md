# User Story 2.7: Advanced Analysis Techniques

**Priority:** Low

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to use advanced techniques like reflection or runtime analysis where applicable for deeper insights beyond static analysis (e.g., for languages that support it).

## Tasks
- [ ] Research feasibility of reflection/runtime analysis for supported languages
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement basic reflection/runtime analysis for applicable languages (e.g., Java, Python)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Applicable to Java, Python; research feasibility for others. Focus on specific high-value insights.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System can leverage reflection/runtime analysis for languages where it's feasible and provides valuable insights.
- Static analysis remains the primary method for other languages.
