# User Story 2.5: Automatic Analysis Update

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to automatically update its analysis when files change, using mechanisms like file timestamps or change detection, so that it stays current with minimal effort.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement file change detection mechanism (timestamps, file system events)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Trigger re-analysis for changed files
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Consider efficiency for large projects.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System automatically detects file changes (add, modify, delete).
- Analysis is updated for changed files without requiring manual intervention.
