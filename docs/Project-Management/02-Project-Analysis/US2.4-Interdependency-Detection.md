# User Story 2.4: Interdependency Detection

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to detect interdependencies between different code files and modules, including language-specific import statements, so that I understand how changes might impact the codebase.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement logic to parse import/require/alias statements for supported languages
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Store detected interdependencies
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Handle Ruby’s `require`, Elixir’s `alias/import/use`, Java’s `import`, etc.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Interdependencies between code files/modules are correctly identified for all supported languages.
- Language-specific import mechanisms are handled.
