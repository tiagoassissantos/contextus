# User Story 11.1: Language-Specific Parsers

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to have dedicated parsers for each supported programming language so that it can accurately analyze code across different languages.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement or integrate parsers for statically-typed languages (Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, Rust, Go)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement or integrate parsers for dynamically-typed languages (Python, JavaScript, Ruby)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create a common interface for all language parsers
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Consider using existing parsing libraries where available. Focus on extracting consistent structural information across languages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All supported languages have functioning parsers
- Parsers extract consistent structural information regardless of language
- System handles language-specific syntax correctly
- Parser errors are handled gracefully with useful error messages
