# User Story 11.4: Language Feature Detection

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to detect and understand language-specific features and idioms so that analysis is accurate for each language.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement detection for Ruby metaprogramming patterns
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Support Elixir macros and protocol implementations
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Handle other language-specific features (e.g., Python decorators, JavaScript prototypes)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Prioritize features that impact dependency analysis and code understanding. Consider how to represent these features in the dependency graph.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System correctly identifies and handles Ruby metaprogramming
- Elixir macros and protocols are properly analyzed
- Other language-specific features are detected and represented
- Analysis results account for language idioms and patterns
