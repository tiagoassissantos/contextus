# User Story 13.2: Code Change Updates

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to update its internal state when code changes so that it always provides accurate information based on the current codebase.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement real-time file system monitoring
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create efficient incremental update mechanisms
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Develop a strategy for updating embeddings and indexes
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Focus on minimizing the performance impact of updates. Consider batching changes for more efficient processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System detects code changes in real-time
- Analysis data is updated promptly after changes
- Updates are efficient and don't disrupt user experience
- System correctly reflects the current state of the codebase
