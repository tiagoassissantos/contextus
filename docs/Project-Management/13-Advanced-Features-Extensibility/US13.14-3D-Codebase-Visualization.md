# User Story 13.14: 3D Codebase Visualization

**Priority:** Low

## Description
As a Developer, I want a 3D visualization of large codebases so that I can explore complex projects innovatively.

## Tasks
- [ ] Research and select appropriate 3D visualization libraries
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Design 3D representation of codebase structure
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement interactive 3D visualization with navigation controls
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Focus on creating an intuitive and useful visualization, not just a visually impressive one. Consider performance implications for very large codebases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- 3D visualization represents codebase structure in an intuitive way
- Navigation controls allow easy exploration of the visualization
- Performance remains acceptable even for large codebases
- Visualization provides meaningful insights not available in 2D views
- Users can interact with the visualization to access detailed information
