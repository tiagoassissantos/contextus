# User Story 13.10: Advanced Visualizations

**Priority:** Low

## Description
As a Developer, I want advanced visualizations like heat maps for code complexity and time-based views of code evolution so that I gain deeper insights.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design and implement code complexity heat maps
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create time-based visualizations of code evolution
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Develop interactive controls for visualization customization
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Use modern visualization libraries that work well in web environments. Consider performance implications for large codebases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Heat maps clearly show code complexity across the codebase
- Time-based visualizations show how code has evolved over time
- Visualizations are interactive and customizable
- Performance remains acceptable even for large codebases
- Visualizations can be exported or shared with team members
