# User Story 13.7: Intelligent Context Management

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want intelligent context management, including prediction based on behavior and adaptive selection, so that context is optimized.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement behavior tracking to identify patterns in developer queries
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Develop predictive algorithms for context selection
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create adaptive context management that improves over time
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Consider using machine learning techniques to improve context selection over time. Privacy considerations should be addressed in behavior tracking implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System tracks and analyzes developer query patterns
- Context selection improves based on past interactions
- System adapts to different developers' working styles
- Context relevance improves over time with usage
- Privacy controls allow developers to manage behavior tracking
