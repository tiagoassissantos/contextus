# User Story 13.1: Conversational Context

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to maintain conversational context for follow-up questions so that I can have more natural interactions without repeating information.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design a conversation history storage mechanism
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement context-aware query processing
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create a system to reference previous questions and answers
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Balance between maintaining useful context and avoiding context pollution. Consider mechanisms to explicitly clear or modify conversation context.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System correctly interprets follow-up questions
- Previous context is appropriately incorporated into responses
- Users can reference previous questions or answers
- Conversation history is maintained across sessions
