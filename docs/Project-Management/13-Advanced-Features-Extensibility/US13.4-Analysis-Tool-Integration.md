# User Story 13.4: Analysis Tool Integration

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to integrate with additional code analysis tools so that I can leverage specialized insights.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design an integration framework for external tools
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement integrations for common static analysis tools
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create a mechanism to incorporate external tool results into the system
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Focus on tools that provide complementary insights (e.g., security scanners, complexity analyzers). Consider how to normalize and present diverse analysis results.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System successfully integrates with at least three external tools
- Analysis results are incorporated into the knowledge base
- Integration is configurable and extensible
- External tool insights are accessible through the system's interfaces
