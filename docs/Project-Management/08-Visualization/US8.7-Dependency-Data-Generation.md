# User Story 8.7: Dependency Data Generation

**Priority:** Low

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to generate data representing the project's dependency graph (nodes and edges) so that it can be visualized or processed externally.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define a standard format for dependency graph data
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement data generation from the system's dependency analysis
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create API endpoints or export functions for accessing the data
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
The generated data should be in a standard format (JSON, GraphML) that can be consumed by external visualization or analysis tools.

## Acceptance Criteria
- System generates complete dependency graph data in a standard format
- Data includes all relevant metadata (file types, dependency types, etc.)
- API or export functions provide access to the data
- Data can be filtered or scoped to specific parts of the project
- Generated data is valid and can be consumed by external tools
- Performance is acceptable even for large projects
