  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Exported visualizations should maintain their visual styling and include relevant metadata. Consider adding options for including/excluding certain elements or annotations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Visualizations can be exported as images (PNG, SVG)
- Graph data can be exported in standard formats (GraphML, DOT)
- Export options allow customizing the output
- Exported files maintain visual fidelity and include relevant details
- Large visualizations export correctly without truncation
- Export process provides progress feedback for large graphs
