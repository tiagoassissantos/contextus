# User Story 8.8: Hybrid Visualization

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want a hybrid visualization combining directory and dependency views so that I get a comprehensive perspective.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design a hybrid visualization that combines directory structure and dependencies
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement the hybrid view with appropriate layout algorithms
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Add controls for adjusting the balance between structure and dependencies
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
The hybrid view should allow users to see both the physical organization (directory structure) and logical organization (dependencies) simultaneously. Consider using techniques like hierarchical edge bundling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Visualization shows both directory structure and dependencies
- Users can adjust the emphasis between structure and dependencies
- Layout is clear and avoids excessive visual clutter
- Interactive features work consistently with other visualization types
- Performance remains acceptable with the combined visualization
- Users can easily switch between hybrid and single-focus views
