# User Story 8.2: Directory Tree View

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want to see a directory tree view of my project with integrated dependency information so that I can explore relationships in a familiar format.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement a collapsible directory tree component
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Integrate dependency information into the tree view
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Add visual indicators for files with many dependencies
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
The directory tree should follow standard conventions (collapsible folders, file icons) while adding visual cues for dependency information.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Directory structure is accurately represented in a collapsible tree
- Files and folders have appropriate icons and visual styling
- Dependency information is integrated (e.g., badges showing dependency count)
- Clicking on a file shows its dependencies and dependents
- Tree supports standard operations (expand/collapse, scroll, search)
- Performance remains good even with large directory structures
