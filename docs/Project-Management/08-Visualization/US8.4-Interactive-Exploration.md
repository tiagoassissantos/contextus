# User Story 8.4: Interactive Exploration

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want to interactively explore the visualization, including zooming, panning, clicking on nodes for details, and filtering views, so that I can focus on specific areas.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement core interactive features (zoom, pan, selection)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Develop detailed information panels for selected elements
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create filtering and search capabilities for visualizations
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Interactivity should feel natural and responsive. Consider implementing features like semantic zoom, where different levels of detail are shown at different zoom levels.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can zoom in/out and pan across all visualization types
- Clicking on elements shows detailed information in a panel
- Search functionality allows finding specific elements quickly
- Filtering options enable focusing on relevant parts of the visualization
- Navigation history allows going back to previous views
- Performance remains smooth during interactive operations
