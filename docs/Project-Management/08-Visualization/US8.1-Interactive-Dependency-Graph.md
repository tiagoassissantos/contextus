# User Story 8.1: Interactive Dependency Graph

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want to view an interactive dependency graph showing relationships between files and modules so that I can visualize the codebase structure.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design the dependency graph visualization model and layout algorithms
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement graph rendering using a suitable visualization library
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Add interactivity features (zoom, pan, click for details)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Consider using a force-directed layout for automatic organization of nodes. The graph should handle large codebases gracefully, possibly through progressive loading or clustering.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Graph accurately displays files/modules as nodes and dependencies as edges
- Direction of dependencies is clearly indicated (e.g., through arrows)
- Nodes are visually distinguishable by file type or module category
- Users can interact with the graph through zoom, pan, and selection
- Selecting a node shows detailed information about the file/module
- Graph remains responsive even with large codebases
