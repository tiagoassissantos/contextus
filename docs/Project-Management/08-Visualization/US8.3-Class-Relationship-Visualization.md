# User Story 8.3: Class Relationship Visualization

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want to visualize class inheritance and composition relationships for object-oriented languages so that I can understand design patterns.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design visualization for class relationships (inheritance, composition, etc.)
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement class diagram generation for supported OO languages
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Add interactive features specific to class relationships
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Focus on standard UML-like notation for class relationships. Support should include inheritance, composition, aggregation, and implementation relationships where applicable to the language.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Class relationships are visualized using standard notation
- Different relationship types are visually distinct
- Diagram supports all major OO languages in the system
- Users can filter by relationship type
- Clicking on a class shows its members and detailed information
- Diagram can be navigated to explore complex inheritance hierarchies
