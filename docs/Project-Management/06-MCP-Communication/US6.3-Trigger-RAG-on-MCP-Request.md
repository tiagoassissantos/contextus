# User Story 6.3: Trigger RAG on MCP Request

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, upon receiving an MCP request, I want to trigger the RAG retrieval process and format the context for the LLM so that queries are processed efficiently.

## Tasks
- [ ] Integrate MCP request handling (US 6.2) with the RAG pipeline (Epic 5).
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Extract query information from the MCP request.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Execute the vector similarity search (US 5.4) based on the query.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Execute context formatting (US 5.5) using the retrieved results.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
This connects the communication layer with the core RAG functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- An incoming MCP request for context retrieval successfully triggers the RAG process.
- The query from the request is used to perform the vector search.
- The results from the search are formatted according to US 5.5.
- The process handles potential errors during retrieval or formatting.
