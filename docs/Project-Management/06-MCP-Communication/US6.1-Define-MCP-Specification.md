# User Story 6.1: Define MCP Specification

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I need a defined MCP specification outlining request/response formats for context retrieval and Q&A so that communication is standardized.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define request format for context retrieval (input query, parameters).
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Define response format for context retrieval (formatted context from US 5.5, metadata).
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Define request/response formats for other potential interactions (e.g., basic code exploration commands).
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Choose a protocol (e.g., JSON-RPC, Protobuf, simple HTTP REST).
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Document the MCP specification clearly.
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Collaborate with the LLM backend/editor agent team to ensure compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A formal MCP specification document exists.
- The specification defines clear request and response structures for RAG context retrieval.
- The specification defines the communication protocol (e.g., JSON-RPC over HTTP).
- The specification is agreed upon by relevant teams (RAG system, LLM backend/agent).
