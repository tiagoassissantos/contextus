# User Story 6.2: Expose MCP Endpoint

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to expose an MCP endpoint (e.g., HTTP server, WebSocket) to receive requests from the LLM backend or editor agent so that integration is seamless.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement a server (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket) to listen for incoming MCP requests.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement request handling logic to parse incoming requests according to the MCP spec (US 6.1).
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Ensure the endpoint is configurable (e.g., port number).
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Consider security implications for the exposed endpoint.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The RAG system runs a server listening on a configurable endpoint.
- The server correctly receives and parses requests conforming to the MCP specification.
- Basic health check or status endpoint is available.
