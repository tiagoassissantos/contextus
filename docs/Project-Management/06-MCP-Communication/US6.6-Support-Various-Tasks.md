# User Story 6.6: Support Various Tasks

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to support various tasks such as Q&A, code explanation, debugging assistance, and code generation so that it aids my workflow.

## Tasks
- [ ] Ensure the context retrieved and formatted (Epic 5, US 6.4) is suitable for different downstream LLM tasks (Q&A, explanation, etc.).
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Potentially allow MCP requests (US 6.1) to specify the intended task type to influence context retrieval (e.g., retrieve different types of context for debugging vs. code generation).
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Test the end-to-end flow (US 6.5) with different types of developer queries representing these tasks.
  - Assigned to: [QA/Developer]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
The RAG system primarily provides context; the LLM performs the task. This story ensures the provided context is versatile.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Context retrieved by the RAG system via MCP proves useful for LLM-powered Q&A about the codebase.
- Context retrieved by the RAG system via MCP proves useful for LLM-powered code explanation.
- Context retrieved by the RAG system via MCP proves useful for LLM-powered debugging assistance.
- Context retrieved by the RAG system via MCP proves useful for LLM-powered code generation relevant to the existing codebase.
