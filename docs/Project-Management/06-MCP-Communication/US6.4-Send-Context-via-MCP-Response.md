# User Story 6.4: Send Context via MCP Response

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to send the formatted context back to the requester via the MCP response so that the request cycle completes.

## Tasks
- [ ] Take the formatted context (from US 6.3) and construct the MCP response message according to the spec (US 6.1).
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Send the response back to the client that made the MCP request.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement error handling for cases where context generation fails, sending an appropriate error response via MCP.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Completes the request-response loop for context retrieval.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The formatted context generated in US 6.3 is successfully packaged into an MCP response.
- The response is sent back to the original requester via the MCP endpoint (US 6.2).
- The response structure conforms to the MCP specification (US 6.1).
- Errors encountered during the process result in a valid MCP error response.
