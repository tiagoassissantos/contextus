# User Story 6.7: Format LLM Responses

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to handle the formatting and presentation of the LLMâ€™s responses appropriately so that they are easy to read and act upon.

## Tasks
- [ ] (External Task) Define how the editor agent should present LLM responses that were generated using RAG context.
  - Assigned to: [Editor Agent Team]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Potentially provide metadata in the MCP response (US 6.4) that could aid the editor agent in formatting (e.g., source file references).
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
This is primarily the responsibility of the client (editor agent) consuming the LLM response, but the RAG system might provide helpful metadata.

## Acceptance Criteria
- (External) LLM responses enhanced by RAG context are presented clearly in the developer's UI (e.g., editor).
- If the RAG system provides metadata in the MCP response, it is useful for the client's presentation logic.
