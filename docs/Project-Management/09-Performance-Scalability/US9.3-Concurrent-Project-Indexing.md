# User Story 9.3: Concurrent Project Indexing

**Priority:** Medium

## Description
As a System, I want to support concurrent indexing of multiple projects so that it scales for team use.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design a multi-project architecture that isolates project data
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement resource management to prevent system overload
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create project-specific storage and retrieval mechanisms
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Ensure that concurrent operations don't interfere with each other or degrade system performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Multiple projects can be indexed simultaneously
- Project data remains isolated and secure
- System performance degrades gracefully under load
- Resource usage is monitored and controlled
