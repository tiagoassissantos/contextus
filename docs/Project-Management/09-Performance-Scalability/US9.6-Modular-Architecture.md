# User Story 9.6: Modular Architecture

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want the architecture to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy extension or replacement of components, so that it evolves with new requirements.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define clear interfaces between system components
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement dependency injection or similar patterns
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Create documentation for extending or replacing components
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Focus on loose coupling and high cohesion in the architecture design.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Components can be replaced without affecting other parts of the system
- New features can be added with minimal changes to existing code
- Architecture documentation clearly explains extension points
- System passes integration tests after component modifications
