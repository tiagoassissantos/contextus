  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement LRU or similar caching for query results
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Develop cache invalidation strategies for code changes
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Balance memory usage with performance gains. Consider time-based and usage-based cache expiration strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Repeated queries show significant performance improvement
- Cache hit rate exceeds 80% for typical usage patterns
- Cache invalidation correctly handles code changes
- Memory usage remains within acceptable limits
