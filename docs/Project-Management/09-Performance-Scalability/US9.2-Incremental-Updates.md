# User Story 9.2: Incremental Updates

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to implement incremental updates to avoid full rescans when possible so that performance is maintained.

## Tasks
- [ ] Develop a change detection mechanism to identify modified files
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement selective re-analysis for changed files only
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Update dependency graph and related data structures incrementally
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Consider using file timestamps, hashes, or other efficient change detection methods.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Only modified files are re-analyzed
- Dependency information is correctly updated after incremental changes
- Significant performance improvement compared to full rescans
- System maintains data consistency after incremental updates
