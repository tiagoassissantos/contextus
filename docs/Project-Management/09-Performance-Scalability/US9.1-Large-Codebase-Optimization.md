# User Story 9.1: Large Codebase Optimization

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a System, I want to optimize scanning and analysis processes for large codebases to handle millions of lines of code efficiently so that it supports enterprise projects.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement efficient file traversal algorithms for large directory structures
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Optimize memory usage during code analysis
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for code analysis where applicable
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Focus on both time and space complexity. Consider using streaming approaches for very large files.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Successfully analyzes codebases with 1M+ lines of code
- Memory usage remains within acceptable limits
- Analysis completes within reasonable time (benchmark against industry standards)
- Performance metrics are documented
