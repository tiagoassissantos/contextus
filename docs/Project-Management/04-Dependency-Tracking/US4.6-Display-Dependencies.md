# User Story 4.6: Display Dependencies Clearly

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to display dependencies for a given file clearly so that I can quickly understand its connections.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design a clear and concise output format for presenting dependency query results (from US 4.2 and US 4.3).
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Implement the presentation logic for the designed format (e.g., in CLI output, API response).
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Consider options for indicating dependency type (local/external, US 4.4) in the display.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Presentation is key for usability. Could be simple text lists initially.

## Acceptance Criteria
- When querying for dependents (US 4.2) or dependencies (US 4.3), the output is formatted in a human-readable way.
- The output clearly lists the relevant files/modules/libraries.
- The format is consistent and easy to parse programmatically if needed (e.g., structured JSON for API).
