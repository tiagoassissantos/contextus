# User Story 4.3: Query Dependencies

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want to query the system to find out which files/modules a specific file/module depends on (dependencies or outgoing references) so that I understand its requirements.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement a query mechanism/API endpoint to retrieve dependencies for a given file/module identifier.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Ensure the query efficiently retrieves the list of dependencies from the stored data (US 4.1).
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Define the format for the query response.
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
This helps in understanding what other parts of the codebase or external libraries a specific file/module needs to function.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A query function/API exists that accepts a file/module identifier.
- The query returns an accurate list of all files/modules/libraries that the specified target directly depends on.
- Query performance is acceptable for typical project sizes.
