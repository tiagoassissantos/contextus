# User Story 4.1: Map Bidirectional Dependencies

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to map bidirectional dependencies between files and modules for all supported languages so that I can see complete relationships.

## Tasks
- [ ] Define data structure for storing bidirectional dependencies (both outgoing and incoming references).
  - Assigned to: [Team/Person]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Enhance analysis modules (Epic 2) to identify both outgoing dependencies (e.g., imports, requires) and potentially infer incoming references.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Store the identified bidirectional relationships in persistent storage (Epic 3).
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Store relationships like “File A requires File B” and implicitly “File B is required by File A” or “Module A aliases Module B” and implicitly “Module B is aliased by Module A”.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system stores dependency relationships in a way that allows querying both what a file/module depends on and what depends on it.
- Relationships are correctly identified and stored for all supported languages based on their specific mechanisms (require, import, alias, etc.).
- Dependency data reflecting these relationships is persisted.
