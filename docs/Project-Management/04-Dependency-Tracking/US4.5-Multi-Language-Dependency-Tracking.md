# User Story 4.5: Multi-Language Dependency Tracking

**Priority:** High

## Description
As a Developer, I want the system to handle dependency tracking accurately for all supported languages so that it works seamlessly across projects.

## Tasks
- [ ] Verify and refine dependency parsing logic (Epic 2) for language-specific constructs (imports, requires, uses, aliases, etc.) in Ruby, Elixir, Go, Kotlin, Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Ensure consistent storage (US 4.1) and querying (US 4.2, US 4.3) of dependencies regardless of the source language.
  - Assigned to: [Developer Name]
  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Add comprehensive test cases covering various dependency scenarios for each supported language.

  - Due date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Notes
Crucial for the system's core value proposition of supporting diverse codebases.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dependency mapping (US 4.1) correctly identifies relationships based on the specific syntax and conventions of each supported language.
- Dependency querying (US 4.2, US 4.3) returns accurate results for projects written in any of the supported languages or a mix of them.
- Test suite confirms correct dependency tracking across all languages.
