### User Story 1.1 Detail:
**Title**: System Initialization for New Project Directory  
**Role**: System Operator  
**Goal**: I want a defined process to initialize the system for a new project directory  
**Benefit**: So that I can set up the system easily for new projects.  
**Priority**: High  
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] System provides a command-line interface (CLI) command such as `contextus init <directory>`.
- [ ] Upon initialization, the system creates required configuration files and directories.
- [ ] Initialization validates that the given directory exists and is accessible.
- [ ] If the initialization is successful, the system returns a success message clearly indicating completion.
- [ ] If the initialization fails, the system clearly indicates the error reason.

---

### Tasks Breakdown for Development:

#### Task 1: Define Initialization Command
- [ ] Specify the exact CLI syntax (`contextus init <directory>`) clearly.
- [ ] Determine command-line argument handling (mandatory/optional arguments, validation).

#### Task 2: Project Directory Validation
- [ ] Implement logic to check if the given directory exists.
- [ ] Verify directory permissions (read/write permissions).
- [ ] Write test cases to ensure directory validation logic works correctly.

#### Task 3: Configuration and Initial Directory Structure Setup
- [ ] Define standard initial configuration files (e.g., `.contextus/config.json`).
- [ ] Define necessary subdirectories structure (e.g., `.contextus/data`, `.contextus/logs`).
- [ ] Develop functionality to create the initial files and directories upon initialization.
- [ ] Write unit tests ensuring configuration files and directories are created correctly.

#### Task 4: Success and Error Messaging
- [ ] Implement clear and user-friendly success messages upon completion of initialization.
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error messages covering common initialization failure scenarios.
- [ ] Test that correct messages appear in all scenarios.

#### Task 5: Error Handling and Edge Cases
- [ ] Implement error handling for file system exceptions (e.g., permission denied, disk full).
- [ ] Consider edge cases such as existing but incomplete `.contextus` configurations.
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for all identified edge cases and error scenarios.

#### Task 6: Documentation and CLI Help
- [ ] Write documentation for the `contextus init` command in README or CLI help.
- [ ] Include usage examples and troubleshooting information.

#### Task 7: Integration and Smoke Testing
- [ ] Perform integration testing to ensure initialization process interacts correctly with other system components (e.g., logging, subsequent commands).
- [ ] Conduct smoke tests in different operating environments (Linux, macOS, Windows).

#### Task 8: Code Review and Refactoring
- [ ] Peer review initialization command implementation for quality assurance.
- [ ] Refactor the initialization process to adhere to clean code standards (SOLID, DRY).
